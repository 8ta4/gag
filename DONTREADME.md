## Goals

### Laughter

> Does `gag` aim to make everyone laugh?

No. `gag` aims not to make everyone laugh but to achieve net positive upvotes in the r/jokes subreddit, acknowledging humor's subjective nature.

> What's the target likelihood for jokes to achieve net positive upvotes?

`gag` is designed with the target of a 95% likelihood that the jokes it generates will receive net positive upvotes when shared in the r/jokes subreddit.

> Why is it a 95% likelihood for achieving net positive upvotes?

95% is the golden number in academic research to say, "Yeah, we're pretty sure this is legit."

> Why use Reddit for evaluating jokes?

Reddit's whole upvote/downvote game gives us a solid number to work with. This feature allows us to use upvotes as a proxy for humor effectiveness.

> Why specifically target the r/jokes subreddit?

The r/jokes subreddit is the largest community for jokesters on Reddit.

### Topicality

> What metric is used to evaluate the topicality of jokes generated by `gag`?

`gag` utilizes cosine similarity to evaluate the topicality of jokes.

> What is the target cosine similarity score `gag` aims for in joke generation?

The target cosine similarity score `gag` aims for is 0.1.

A threshold of 0.1 ensures jokes are not entirely off-topic, facilitating their integration into relevant discussions by providing enough leeway for users to incorporate the joke, much like how late-night show hosts steer conversations to introduce their bits.

### Budget

> What is the monthly budget goal?

The goal is to keep monthly usage under $100. This threshold is chosen based on the observation that most productivity tools are priced below this mark.

> Will `gag` aim to maintain a monthly budget goal for heavy social media users like Trump?

Yes. To gauge whether the tool supports users with high social media engagement, consider the activity of Donald Trump, the greatest comedian in the history of the universe. Imagine if Trump needed a joke for every tweet. During his presidency, Trump shared a total of 26,237 tweets. His term began on January 20, 2017, and his Twitter activity continued until January 8, 2021, the day his access to the platform was suspended. The span between the start of his term and the suspension of his Twitter account totals 1,450 days, considering both the start and end dates inclusively. Given an average of 30 days per month, and assuming each tweet might require a joke, the following formula calculates the cost per joke:

$$\frac{100\text{ dollar/month} \times 1,450\text{ d}}{30\text{ d/month} \times 26,237\text{ tweets}} \approx 0.18\text{ dollar}$$
