## Goals

### Laughter

> Does `gag` aim to make everyone laugh?

`gag` doesn't aim to make every single person laugh. Instead, `gag` aims to create jokes that a specific user finds more statistically significantly funnier based on a user-customized set of criteria than a joke they provide. This comparison involves a statistical test to evaluate the joke's humor value against the user-provided joke.

> What statistical test does `gag` use?

To decide if a joke is funnier than a user's example, `gag` uses a binomial test. This test is chosen because each evaluation of a joke represents a binary outcome, akin to a success or failure in a series of independent trials. The binomial test helps determine if the proportion of successes is significantly higher than what would be expected by chance, given a certain confidence level.

> What is the target confidence level?

The target confidence level is 95%.

> Why is the target confidence level 95%?

95% is the number in academic research to say, "Yeah, we're pretty sure this is legit."

> Does using language models to evaluate humor lead to a misalignment with human sense of humor?

Yes, using language models to assess humor can sometimes not align with how humans perceive humor. This challenge is not unique to language models but is also present in other methods like analyzing datasets from online forums or conducting human trials. All three methods grapple with the issue of accurately reflecting the humor preferences of diverse individuals.

Analyzing datasets from online forums introduces further issues due to its uncontrolled observational nature. These additional complications include:

- Traffic Fluctuations: Variability in site traffic affects the visibility.
- Timing of Posts: The success of a joke can depend on when it is posted, due to varying audience sizes at different times.
- Changing Community Composition: The evolving demographics of online communities over time can shift the prevailing sense of humor.
- Popularity Bias: Jokes going viral might receive higher ratings for reasons other than their humor quality.

Conducting human trials to evaluate humor is also challenging due to the significant financial investments required.

### Relevance

> What metric is used to evaluate the relevance of jokes generated by `gag`?

`gag` utilizes cosine similarity to evaluate the relevance of jokes.

> What is the target cosine similarity score `gag` aims for in joke generation?

The target cosine similarity score `gag` aims for is 0.1.

A threshold of 0.1 ensures jokes are not entirely off-topic, facilitating their integration into relevant discussions by providing enough leeway for users to incorporate the joke, much like how late-night show hosts steer conversations to introduce their bits.

### Budget

> What is the monthly budget goal?

The goal is to keep monthly usage under $100. This threshold is chosen based on the observation that most productivity tools are priced below this mark.

> Will `gag` aim to maintain a monthly budget goal for heavy social media users like Trump?

Yes. To gauge whether the tool supports users with high social media engagement, consider the activity of Donald Trump, the greatest comedian in the history of the universe. Imagine if Trump needed a joke for every tweet. During his presidency, Trump shared a total of 26,237 tweets. His term began on January 20, 2017, and his Twitter activity continued until January 8, 2021, the day his access to the platform was suspended. The span between the start of his term and the suspension of his Twitter account totals 1,450 days, considering both the start and end dates inclusively. Given an average of 30 days per month, and assuming each tweet might require a joke, the following formula calculates the cost per joke:

$$\frac{100\text{ dollar/month} \times 1,450\text{ d}}{30\text{ d/month} \times 26,237\text{ tweets}} \approx 0.18\text{ dollar}$$
